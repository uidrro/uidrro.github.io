        <p>I do computer stuff. Take a look at my first rack. It's got my networking equipment, a Linux PC, Windows PC, and a full-blown server!</p>
        <p>Unifi equipment makes up the backbone of my network, though I do have separate devices that handle the firewall, DNS, and DCHP that aren't visible in the picture, but are on top of the rack.</p>
        <p>The Linux PC runs Ubuntu. I've used Ubuntu as my daily driver for almost 4 years now and it's so much more fun than Windows. Much less expensive too!</p>
        <p>The Windows PC is used primarily for games at the moment. Eventually, I'll move the games storage to a network folder, put Windows in a VM, and use the PC for something else.</p>
        <p>The server currently runs XCP-NG as a Type I hypervisor. It works great as long as the VM's can reach the DHCP server. Not sure what I broke with that, but the communication doesn't always go through. I'll figure it out at some point.</p>
        <p>Some of the projects I've been working on are wiring up the house for 10Gb with cat6A cable, fixing network issues on the XCP-NG server so that I can finish setting up a lab environment, creating a financial tracker, and getting a degree.</p>
