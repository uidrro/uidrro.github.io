This page describes recovering from compromise.

Notes:

* Account takeovers need password reset and device sessions audited. Enable phishing-resistant MFA.
* Financial compromise. Freeze credit with bureaus. One credit report from all three each year. On compromise, better to pay for extras than miss rogue accounts.
* Contact bank, inform of compromise. Ask for next steps.
* Federal resource links.
