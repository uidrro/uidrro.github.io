# Phishing Emails

We all know _what_ to look for when it comes to phishing emails because it's been covered repeatedly in basic security trainings.

*   Unfamiliar email addresses
*   Poor grammar and misspellings
*   Messages designed to evoke an emotional rather than logical response
*   Requests to pay now and receive large sums of money later
*   Romance scam/pig slaughtering

But what do phishing emails **_actually_** look like in practice? There's a lot of "flavors" of phishing emails depending on the tactic being used, but here are a few examples.

Most of these are screenshots taken from our alerts! Some of them might actually look pretty well done until you recognize what you're looking at!

If you do click a link in a suspicious email, don't fret. But don't do nothing about it either. As soon as you realize it, let your boss know and call the helpdesk to have a ticket forwarded for investigation. Your credentials will likely be reset and active sessions terminated in an abundance of caution.

But what do **_these_** sites look like? We'll show you a few more examples.
