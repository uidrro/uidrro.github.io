# Phishing Emails

We all know _what_ to look for when it comes to phishing emails because it's been beated into our heads.

*   Unfamiliar email addresses
*   Poor grammar and misspellings
*   Threats to send our naughty browsing habits to family and coworkers
*   Requests to pay now and receive large sums of money later

And so on and so forth. But what do phishing emails **_actually_** look like in practice?
