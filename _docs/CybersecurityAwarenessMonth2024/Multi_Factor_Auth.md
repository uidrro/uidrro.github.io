**********UNDER MAINTENANCE**********
This page describes MFA.

Notes:

* SMS is weak due to Telco staff compromise
* 6-digit codes are phish-prone
* Key > App > Email
* Request sensitive accounts integrate app or key-based MFA and move from SMS
* Type of MFA used can be incredibly annoying when abused. Texted codes, voice verification, app notifications, etc. (Turn off MFA app notifications, open only when needed)
* **KEEP COPIES OF BACKUP CODES WRITTEN DOWN IN SAFE PLACE**
